The Swift.org community has the singular goal of making the world’s best general purpose programming language. Collectively we will develop the language in the open, with contributions from anyone who wishes to participate. This guideline document describes how the Swift community is organized so that we can work together to add amazing new capabilities to Swift, and make it available to even more developers across more platforms.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Swift.
Contributing doesn't just mean submitting pull requests -- there are many different ways for you to get involved, including answering questions on the forums, reporting or triaging bugs, and participating in the Swift evolution process.

No matter how you want to get involved, we ask that you first learn what's expected of anyone who participates in the project by reading the [Code of Conduct](https://www.swift.org/code-of-conduct/).

## Communication

The Swift language is developed in the open, and all technical or administrative topics about the language or community processes should be directed to the Swift public forums. Public conversations are encouraged, and active developers of the Swift language should monitor the relevant forum categories.

- Asking and answering questions in the [forums](./forums.md]
- [reporting bugs](./reporting-bugs.md)
- [triaging bugs](./triaging-bugs.md)
- [good first issues](./good-first-issues.md)
- [swift evolution process](./swift-evolution.md)
- [contributing code](./contributing-code.md)
- [contributor ladder](./contributor-ladder.md)

Source code for Swift projects can be found on GitHub at [github.com/swiftlang](https://github.com/swiftlang).
The Swift bug tracking system is maintained at [github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues](http://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues).
