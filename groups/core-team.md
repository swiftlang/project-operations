# Swift Core Team

The Core Team provides cohesion across the Swift community’s various Groups and initiatives, providing support and strategic alignment. The Project Lead appoints members of the Core Team to bring a mixture of experience, expertise, and leadership so the group may together act as effective stewards for the Swift project and its community. The Core Team membership is expected to change over time with check-ins at a two year mark.  
  
Ted Kremenek is the Chair of the Core Team, also known as the Project Lead. Apple's Software Engineering leadership appoints the Project Lead. 

The Core Team is responsible for approving the following:
- The creation and archival process of repositories in the github.com/swiftlang organization 
- Proposals and charters for newly created Groups; Providing Members for new Steering Groups 
- Major swift.org changes
- Announcements on forums.swift.org
- Roadmaps and Vision Docs of Steering Groups
