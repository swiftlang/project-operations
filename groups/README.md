# Swift Groups

Three types of groups play an integral role in shaping Swifts development: Workgroups, Steering Groups, and the Core Team.  

Groups are formed by interested community members reaching out to an already established Steering Group on the [Swift Forums](forums.swift.org) to see if it fits into the goals of the Swift project at this time. If so, the established Steering Group will sponsor and a charter template will be used to kick off wider dicussions with the community. The charter used to document the scope, purpose, members, community participation information, and operational processes. Established Groups charter changes go through the Core Team for final approval. 

## Workgroups

Workgroups are the heart of the engineering and development work of the project. Workgroups represent functional areas of the project and drive work in a particular area that fall within the scope of a Steering Group or the Core Team. Subgroups of Workgroups help further refine tasks and deliverables. Workgroups are long-term and focus on a specific domain. Various active contributors lead Workgroups.

## Steering Groups 

Steering Groups are responsible for the overall strategic direction for broad area such as the overall language and provide stewardship and oversight to Workgroups. 

Steering Groups have evolution authority over specific functional Workgroups of the project. Evolution authority is the ability to determine the means by which a functional area receives improvements. For example, code review may be sufficient for development work in a particular area, but other areas may need a more formal review process to facilitate decision making. Each Steering Group determines the appropriate development model for each of their functional areas, and their charter defines which areas the Steering Group has evolution authority over.

## Core Team

The Core Team provides cohesion across the Swift community’s various Groups and initiatives, providing support and strategic alignment. The Project Lead appoints members of the Core Team to bring a mixture of experience, expertise, and leadership so the group may together act as effective stewards for the Swift project and its community. The Core Team membership is expected to change over time with check-ins at a two year mark.  
  
Ted Kremenek is the Chair of the Core Team, also known as the Project Lead. Apple's Software Engineering leadership appoints the Project Lead.
